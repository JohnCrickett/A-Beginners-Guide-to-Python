## If you wanna help and you are a beginner:

* Basically, go through the lectures and tell me how useful they are
* Is the text/code comments/format clear, helpful, etc?
* Is the difficulty just right? or too hard/easy?
* Are the homeworks engaging?
* Etc, Etc

## If you wanna help and you are an experienced user:

* Please point out any errors of fact, oversimplications, etc
* Is is possible to refactor code examples to be more clear/consise/beginner friendly?
* How to improve formating with Markdown
* Etc, Etc

## Other Contributions...

* pictures/diagrams are often helpful, so if anyone wants to give me graphics let me know. 
* As for other sorts of contributions, just hit me up with a proposal, worst case scenario I say no. :P
* Pointing out bad spelling / typo's / grammar, etc.
