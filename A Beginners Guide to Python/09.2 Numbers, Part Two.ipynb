    "# How Floats work (in a bit more depth)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start the discussion by stating that computers- at the fundamental level- work by flicking on and off trillions of little switches (transistors). When Python receives a number (in any base) it converts that number into base 2 (binary). By converting the number to a bunch of one's and zero's it makes it easier for the machine to calculate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, at the fundamental level, Python is working out sums in base 2 and we puny mortals are thinking in base 10.  Long story short, Python will *round* numbers that cannot be easily expressed in base 2 but interestingly enough of those sums are easy in base 10. The net effect is that there are going to be cases where we feel python makes an “obvious” error in arithmetic; it might seem like a bug when it happens. But actually, these ‘quirks’ are just a consequence of how floats are implemented at the low level.  \n",
