    "# Guide FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi guys, in this lecture I’m going to elaborate a little bit more on the nature of this course, an ‘FAQ’ of sorts. \n",
    "\n",
    "## \"Where are the videos you promised?”\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide started its life on my Youtube channel, I uploaded a video on programming and it was when I started reading the comments on that video I had the idea of writing a beginners guide. The eventual aim to release Youtube videos based on these lectures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When the video content for this guide is finished/started I will leave you a link to follow here. In the meantime however, you are more than welcome to check out my Youtube channel by clinking the link below *(most of the content it gaming related but there are a few Python videos on there as well)*:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [channel link](https://www.youtube.com/c/Smash_the_hamster)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I’m happy with the lectures, I’ll start recording the videoes, some day soon (hopefully).\n",
    "\n",
    "## “Why doesn’t this guide cover sets, dicts, tuples?”\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve left out lots of things for a variety of reasons, the main three reasons being:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I do not have an infinite amount of time to spend on this project.\n",
    "1. Syntax discussion is, though necessary, really boring to teach.\n",
    "1. You must learn to think for yourselves!\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time I increase the ‘scope’ of this project ‘quality’ is going to suffer; more lectures means more typo’s and bugs to catch with less time (per lecture) to catch them in! \n",
    "\n",
    "And then there is the third (and most important) point; programming is about *self-learning* as opposed to being *spoon-fed* material. On numerous occasions through-out this guide I will encourage you to learn for yourselves, my job is to give you a set of tools to teach yourself with!\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, throughout this guide you will notice that I'll be talking about something and then the code I show you ends up introducing something completely new. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, this guide was never indented to be fully comprehensive and if you find yourself wanting to know how ‘X’ works (e.g. Sets, Tuples, Dicts) then the answer is merely a google away. \n",
    "\n",

      "Although practicality beats purity.\n",
      "Errors should never pass silently.\n",
      "Unless explicitly silenced.\n",
      "In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\n",
      "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\n",
      "Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\n",
      "Now is better than never.\n",
      "Although never is often better than *right* now.\n",
      "If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n",
      "If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\n",

    "The Zen of Python is a poem by Tim Peters, each line of which expresses something fundamental about the nature/design of Python. When I started to write this guide from very early on I knew I wanted to teach more than just syntax (anyone can do that), I wanted to write a guide that also instilled some of Python’s philosophy and ethos, without the discussion turning into abstract/pretentious drivel. Such discussion also had to be suitable for beginners as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, I felt that the covering the ‘Zen of Python’  helps achieve these aims succinctly. By the end of this guide you should be able to understand most of what Tim Peter’s was waffling on about!\n",
    "\n",
    "## “This guide is really good, can I use it?”\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m pretty much okay with anyone taking this body of work and doing whatever they want with it *(that’s why I released it with an “MIT” license)*. So long as you give credit and don’t try to sell it for a profit it I don’t really care what you do. \n",

    "\n",
    "Why? Why anything?\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess there are two main reasons why I started this guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I enjoy teaching\n",
    "1. I thought a big shiny project on Github might get me a job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally I've been trying to get an entry level software job for about six months now, 40 applications a month and only two telephone interviews to show for it. I guess being a 29 year old dude with no relevant experience (or a computer science degree) probably means my CV doesn't really get past the *\"HR filter\"*. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I started writing this guide I did so with the hope that maybe-- just maybe-- it would help get me a foot in the door, so to speak. Time will tell I guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the distant future I may add more detailed lecture about landing my first tech job when (if) that happens since if you guys want to learn how to program there is a reasonable chance that some of you maybe interested in learning how I got my break.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On that note, if there are companies out there near London (England...obviously) that want to hire me feel free to say hi. :)"
