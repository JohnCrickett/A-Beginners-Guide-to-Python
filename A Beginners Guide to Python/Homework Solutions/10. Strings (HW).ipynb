I mean think about it, if the string we are handling is part of a book we have to process then its possible that there are going to be hundreds of ‘ in the document; *David’s spoon, can’t, won’t, o’clock* are just a tiny handful of possible phrases that could exist. Do we really want to go through a manuscript to find and then correct such instances? Triple quotes are simply more economical.  "
