    "## A note on Python's \"Lazy\" evaluation...\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets play a simple game. The rules:\n",
    "1. I give you two statements, P, Q and an operator (operator will always be one of \"and/or\")\n",
    "1. Both statements are truth functional (i.e. statements that are True or False)\n",
    "1. Your job is to evaluate the expression (P operator Q) **in the fastest time possible.**\n",
    "1. You get to **choose what to evaluate first**, i.e. your options are P then Q, or Q then P.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, here's the first question:\n",
    "\n",
    "* P = \"There are an infinite number of twin primes\"  \n",
    "* Q = \"7 + 7 is an odd number\"\n",
    "* operator = And\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to once again reiterate the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Is (P and Q) True/False and what is the fastest strategy for solving it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The statement (P and Q) is False, and the fastest strategy is to calculate statement Q first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Well, in order to prove that (P and Q) is False we only have to prove that either P or Q is False. In this case, its pretty easy to see that Q is false, therefore we know the answer of (P and Q) without having to prove the twin primes conjecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, lets try one more time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* P = 7 is a prime number\n",
    "* Q = \"NP = P\"  *([wiki entry for the np = p problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem))*\n",
    "* operator = or\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    “The statement (P or Q) is True, and the fastest strategy is to calculate statement P first.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Similar to the problem above, to prove (P or Q) is True we only have to prove either P or Q is True. In this case, we can quickly check 7 is prime and thus we can solve the problem without even attempting to solve the np=p problem *(which btw, has a million dollar prize for the first person to prove it)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so how can we use this information in our Python programmes? Well Python uses the same \"lazy\" evaluation as we did above; if we know A is True we don't have to calculate B in order to know (A or B) is True. \n",

    "Okay, so how can we use this information in our Python programmes? Well Python uses the same \"lazy\" evaluation as we did above; if we know P is True we don't have to calculate Q in order to know (P or Q) is True. \n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we take advantage of this? Well, the syntax is simple, Python evaluates left-to-right. So in the case of P or Q Python ALWAYS checks P first. To take advantage then, what we should do is give Python the easiest statement first and then the slower one. \n",

    "In the case of the first problem all we would have to do to make Python solve it as fast as we did is to swap P with Q and we're done.\n",
