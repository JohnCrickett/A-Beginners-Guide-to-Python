    "Hi guys, so in this lecture I wanted to talk about speed in Python. Now, as beginners I want to emphasize that you guys should be focusing on writing *correct* programs and not pay too much mind to how fast they run. But with that said it is my opinion that if you want to teach people any skill **THE ABSOLUTE BEST THING you can try to do is inspire them.** Knowledge is easily lost with time but passion tends to stick around a lot longer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, inspiring people is not easy, and in this particular case I don't know anything about you or your life story; which means I can't really 'connect' with you on any meaningful/personal level. But what I can do is share a few of things I enjoy doing/thinking about and hope some of that enthusiasm rubs off on you. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'joy of fast cars' is a somewhat cryptic title, but the explanation of it is fairly straight-forward; one of the things I find a lot of fun is trying to make my code more efficient; I genuinely enjoy the process of taking a bit of code and trying to come up with ways to make it faster.  In my mind programming is at its most interesting when you can can look past stuff like language syntax and instead focus of the very nature of the problem itself. The aim of today is to try to get you a glimpse of that. \n",

    "For example, list comprehensions are faster than for-loops and so I could speed the ‘get_primes’ function by doing that.

But when we look at the total time we see that get_primes took 0.016 seconds on my machine. So a 50% improvement would speed us up by about 0.008 seconds. We are talking 1000th of a second savings here; To hell with that!\n",
