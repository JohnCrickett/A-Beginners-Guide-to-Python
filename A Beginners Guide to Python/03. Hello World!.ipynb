    "Before moving on, I’d like to make quick note about how I talk about syntax in Python. In the lectures where I chose to talk about syntax I use the format above. With the exception of the “{}” symbols, you should assume that **all the the symbols/words are deliberate.** In other words if you see a comma (“,”), a colon (“:”) or whatever its there because Python needs it to be there! The exception to this rule is text sandwiched between the “{}” brackets. This is **MY syntax**, which I use as a 'place-holder'. In this particular case you should remove {argument} and replace with whatever you want to print. Lets run through a few examples:"
