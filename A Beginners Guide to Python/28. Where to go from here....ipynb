    "As we bring this lecture series to a close I wanted to spend a bit of time talking about your future. This course only covered the basics and there is still so much more to learn. My goal for this course was to give your guys a good foundation upon which you can build on. Below are a few of my recommendations for where you could go from here...\n",

    "    \n",
    "I recommend this course because if you want to someday design your own games the projects in this course will be fantastic experience in the long term and in the short term you'll probably enjoy the projects you get to work on. Asteroids, Pong, Blackjack to name just a few. \n",

    "This website has a lot less puzzles, but compared to codewars it offers two main advantages. Firstly, this website is used by recruiters in the tech industry (thats how I learnt about it, actually) and so if you are looking to try to get a job in programming its probably not a bad idea to familiarise yourself with websites like this (if a potential employer wants to test your skills you’ll be ready for it). Secondly, unlike codewars, your solutions are evaluated for both correctness AND efficiency. So for people that enjoyed my \"joy of fast cards lecture\" you might have some fun with these puzzles.\n",

Usually, math education is about learning rote procedures and somewhat rigid mechanical procedures. \n",

    "In contrast, the course tries something different; the focus is on getting your brains to *think* mathematically. The first half of the course is about logic which is pretty relevant to programming. The second part of the course is about constructing mathematical proofs. During the final exam I remember I had to answer a question something like this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Prove that for ALL primes the the ONLY triple prime is [3,5,7]\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now, in my mind the real cool thing about the final exam is that you can solve these problems with very basic mathematical know-how, and honestly that’s the beauty of this question. Its possible to solve this problem with only basic knowledge of [mathmatical induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction) and a basic understanding of what primes are. That’s it. \n",

And so, if you don't consider yourself great at maths I'd recommend you try to solve that problem for homework (for math majors, its way too trivial to interesting, I suspect). Rest assured you have the math skills necessary, but to solve it may take a little ingenuity and logical thought on your part. \n",
