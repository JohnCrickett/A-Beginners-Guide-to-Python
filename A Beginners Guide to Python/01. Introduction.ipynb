    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This series of videos is aimed at the complete beginner. The only thing I am going to assume about you is:\n",
    "* That you have installed Python3 (or above) unto your computer.\n",
    "* Speak English.\n",
    "* Are keen to learn Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "I have designed this lecture series with **Python3.5** in mind. If you are using earlier of more recent versions of Python then some of the code may work unexpectedly (or not at all).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this class we will be using Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook allows you to write code side-by-side with text boxes, allowing for nice looking lecture slides. For more of an explanation/help regarding Jupyter notebook please see the *\"INSTALL HELP & AN INTRODUCTION TO JUPYTER NOTEBOOK\"* lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Updates, Errors, Corrections, Suggestions, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve done my best to provide quality materials but I’m human and mistakes happen. So with that in mind please do feel free to leave me comments/corrections/criticism, etc. I'll do my best to add corrections in a timely fashion.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## About Me\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin I'd like to be clear about who I am and my experience with programming:\n",
    "* **I am not** a professional developer (err, ..any...job offers guys?)\n",
    "* **I did not** study computer science (my degree is in Philosophy, actually).\n",
    "* Everything I know about Python **I taught myself.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Make no mistake guys, I have every intention of making good quality materials but the simple reality is that I am some dude with a mere three years experience in Python trying his best to teach it. I sincerely hope I do a good job but in the meantime I can only be upfront and honest about my understanding and experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lack of experience on my part can, I think, be seen as a positive or a negative. One the one hand it means the materials themselves are more likely to contain errors and/or bad practices than materials produced by professionals *(but hey, if other developers contribute to this project then maybe this problem can be eliminated, hint hint)*. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the bright-side though what happens if I *actually* do a good job with this project? Doesn’t that motivate/inspire at least some of you? The idea that its possible to not only learn Python but also its possible to create something meaningful in such a (relatively) short amount time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there you go, you guys now have a simple choice: to continue to listen to this n00b or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How did I learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of you maybe wondering how I started. Well the main three things I did to get where I am today is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Completing online courses\n",
    "* Solving programming puzzles\n",
    "* **BUILDING STUFF!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion the 'building stuff' is the most important, I'll explain why in the homework section *(yes guys, this series of lectures comes with homework!)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Personal Course Recomendations: \n",
    "\n",
    "> [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Parts 1 & 2)](www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1), Rice University (Coursera).\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the very first course programming I ever took. At the time I found it really hard, but I can't recommend this course highly enough. Each week you will be learning how to build old-school games like Asteroids, Pong, Blackjack and so on.\n",
    "  \n",
    "> [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-8), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Edx)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this is also a hard course, but just like the one above with enough persistence, blood, sweat and tears you will get through it!\n",
    "\n",
    "> [The Design of Computer Programs](https://www.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212), Peter Norvig (Udacity)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an **advanced** course, and if I am to be honest the first time I took it I struggled in places. But there is some really good stuff here and so therefore I'd recommend you make a little reminder to check this course out in six months time. \n",
    "   \n",
    "### For Programming Puzzles...\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few websites out there, but my overall favourite is [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com). I'd strongly recommend you sign up and give a few puzzles a go. If you want to **actually learn** how to program you simply have to get coding and this website will give you plenty of opportunities to practice. Moreover, the the ranking system should help give you a sense of accomplishment and progress as you beat harder and harder puzzles. \n",
    "\n",
    "*p.s I am **NOT** affiliated with this website (or any of the courses listed above, for that matter) in any way what-so-ever.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task for this week is to think of a cool project. If you had the skills and time, what would you build?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A game?\n",
    "* An Automaton that files your taxes?\n",
    "* Cure for Cancer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay okay, finding a cure of cancer would be a huge project, so we might want to tone down the ambition just a bit! But Python is actually pretty good for \"Bioinformatics\". Thus, maybe we can't find a cure for cancer, but writing software that can scan a DNA sequence looking abnormalities is more than doable! \n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, we are never going to be able to make a game like *Call of Duty* by ourselves, but building a game like say *Final Fantasy III* certainly is achievable. In later lectures I’ll talk about how to build Chess and Minesweeper in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, What's your programming dream?  Once you've figured that out try to come up with something a bit more realistic. Hold onto this idea, **This is your motivation**. Learning Python is not going to be easy, there are going to be times where you fall and stumble and if you don’t have a good reason to get *back up* you may just *give up*.\n",
    "To succeed you are going to need to be motivated and that is the idea behind this first homework:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Find your motivation guys. Its bloody important!"
