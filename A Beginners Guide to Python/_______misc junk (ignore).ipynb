    "Yes guys, Python actually has a way to ‘break’ your own code with error messages. Why would you want to do that? Well, it helps safeguard against misuse and garbage output (defensive programming). Later in the course I’ll try to explain why getting garbage out is considerably worse than getting an error message, but until then you’ll just have to trust me. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular example, the first assert statement is asking if mass is a integer or a float. If it is neither we raise the AssertionError with the message “FUUUUUUUU”.\n",

    "Well lets think about the English language for a moment. When writing, we use paragraphs to separate out content. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we create a new paragraph, then that tells the reader that the next chunk of text is a change of topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change of topic is too significant for a new sentence to handle, but its also too minor to require a new heading/chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "And when we do not follow those basics guidelines and split text incorrectly and/or inconsistently it feels a bit weird.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it is much harder to understand what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "isn’t it? \n",
    "\n",
    "The point I'm making here is that it makes a lot sense within English to use blank space as a means of visually separating out our ideas. The result is more readable text. In the code above, I took principle of a 'paragraph' and applied it. More specifically, the first two lines are *about testing* whereas the last two lines are about *getting the stuff done.* And So, **a simple line-break helps visually separate the logically distinct bits of code(within the function).**   \n",
    "\n",
    "So at this point we have made several changes and now function is not considerably more verbose than once was, thats the trade-off we must make if we are to be explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's stop and think about this; what are we *really* doing here? It seems like we are adding bits of code that don't add anything logically necessary to the functioning of our code. Rather, we have added lines of code to essentially explain what the code does and how it should be used. And now I really hope you guys are thinking:\n",
