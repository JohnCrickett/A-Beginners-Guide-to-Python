    "# How to Call Functions...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are functions... \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are an incredibly useful concept and I will cover them in greater detail later on, I promise. But for now lets just say functions are bits of *self-contained code* that take some input value(s), do some process, and return some output. Today we shall be studying how to call functions, for what its worth you guys have already called functions, you just didn't know that was what you are doing!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, we are going to split functions into four basic categories:\n",
    "1. Those that take zero arguments as input.\n",
    "2. Those that take one argument as input.\n",
    "3. Those that take multiple arguments as input.\n",
    "4. Those that take optional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin though I really want to stress that these categories are ***not real***, its an arbitrary distinction that is not founded upon anything of substance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If that’s the case, why do it, then? I here you ask. Well, just because a distinction is not *real* doesn't mean its not helpful. Basically, the reason I have made these categories is because I believe it makes the material easier to teach; a *pedagogical tool*, if you will.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Zero argument functions....\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling zero argument functions are super simple, but they also tend to be rather uniteresting as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The syntax:\n",
    "    {function name} ()\n",
    "    \n",
    "In box below I've quickly made such a function and then calling it. Boring stuff ensues."

    "### 3. Functions with Multiple Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions that take multiple  arguments can be further defined into those that require exactly n arguments and those functions that can handle an arbitrary number of arguments. We shall briefly cover both. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The syntax:\n",
    "    {function name} ({argument}, {argument2}) \n",

    "\n",
    "The syntax for a function that takes an arbitary number of arguments is the same as the above, you just seperate the values by a comma and keep on going. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a matter of fact, we have seen such a function several times already. Its called 'print' : "

    "    The syntax:\n",
    "    {keyword} = {value}\n",
