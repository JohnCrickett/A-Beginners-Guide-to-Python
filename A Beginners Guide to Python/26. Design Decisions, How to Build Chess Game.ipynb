    "## Features of Good Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi guys, this lecture is a bit different, today we are mostly glossing over Python itself and instead we are going to be talk about software development. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this moment in time you are writing tiny programs, programs that in many cases are ten lines (or less) long. And let me tell you, when try your hand at writing programs two, or three-thousand lines long you will quickly learn that not only is it significantly harder to get it working, you will also find **the skills you need change as well**. For small problems, knowledge of  syntax and language semantics are often sufficient and concepts like ‘readability’ can even be ignored (although you shouldn’t). However, if you try to scale up and write something over weeks and months you will likely find your casual disregard for readability ends up biting you. And similarly, if you jumped ‘straight-in’ without considering the ‘bigger picture’ chances are you will end up rewriting a lot of code as you start to realise, weeks later, that the current implementation is not scalable, or something. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today’s lecture is intended as a introduction to some of skills you will likely need once you try to develop a substantial (e.g 300+ line) programs. **The TLDR version; figuring out a good design ‘off the bat’ can potentially save you hours upon hours of work later on down the line.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Today I will be showing you an example of how we might code up a game of chess. But crucially I’m going to skip over a lot of the ‘low-level’ stuff and instead try to provide a ‘high-level’ sketch for what such a program may look like.  On that note, when reading today’s code please consider it a ‘rough sketch’ rather than definitive, if you look at it with a magnifying glass it will collapse like a house of cards. But as I say, today is all about the bigger picture, or  ‘high-level’ thinking. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a saying in England:\n",
    "\n",
    ">“[you] can’t see the forest for the trees”*. \n",
    "\n",
    "It means that if you examine something closely (i.e. each tree) you might miss the bigger picture (i.e. that all the trees come together to make a forest). Well, all of the lectures in this series have been talking about trees, and now we are talking about the forest. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is good design?\n",
    "\n",
    "So before we start looking at a chess game lets say a few words about design; in particular, what counts as good program design?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simplicity\n",
    "\n",
    "    Simple is better than complex.\n",
    "    Complex is better than complicated.\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    "    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n",
    "    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As always, Tim Peter's ‘Zen of Python’ has a thing or two to say about design, the lines highlighted here place an emphasis on simplicity and clarity of expression, these concepts are core to the entire language and we would do well to remember that;  if things start to get complicated maybe it would be prudent to take a step back and reconsider our approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance we might think performance is a 'low-level' consideration. You write something and then find ways to saving a byte of memory here or there. But considering performance merely as ‘fine-tuning’ would be a crucial mistake. \n",
    "\n",
    "Those of you that watched my 'joy of fast cars' lecture would have seen a few examples of such low-level 'fine tuning', in one example I showed how we could optimize a call to range such that we could search for prime numbers faster. And for what it is worth this tinkering did in fact pay off, we were able to lower the time taken from ten seconds to three seconds, our tweaking resulted in a performance boost upwards of 66%.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, that lecture also contained a ‘high-level’ idea as well; our tinkering with the range function was, although faster, still blindly searching for *a needle in a haystack*. We then stepped back and wondered if there was a better way to do it; and with a little help from Google we found a way to *generate* primes efficiently rather than *searching* for them in a sea of non-primes. And the algorithm we found to was over twenty times faster than what we could with ‘low-level’ tinkering. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson here is that good design choices, even if executed poorly, can easily out-perform bad ideas implemented well. If you want to know more about this, please check do some reading on [‘algorithmic complexity’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms) and Big(O) notation (we wont cover this stuff in this course).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, good design/algorithm choices tend to be very performant once we scale up the problem to huge data sets, and this is why its worth taking the time to come up with a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalisable / Reusable\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing good code once and then reusing it is often better than starting from scratch each time. The way to make code reusable is to generalise it to solve variety of problems. This concept is probably best understood by example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we were making a function that counted *1-to-100*. What can we use this for other than its intended purpose? \n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose we write a function that counts from *n-to-m*. This code works for the current problem but because its design is generalised we may be able to reuse this code at a later date, in this project or the next. "

    "#### Beauty\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Beautiful is better than ugly.*  \n",
    "Tim Peters, ‘Zen of Python’\n",
    "\n",
    "Beauty!? At first glance making beauty a consideration my sound like a strange or 'out-of-place' concept. But if you take a broad view of human achievement you’ll find that we mere mortals make things, and then make those things beautiful.  Just think of something like a sword, its an object made with the most brutal of applications in mind and yet we still decided that this was an object worthy of being made beautiful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another discipline where discussions of aesthetics may initially seem out-of-place is mathematics, and yet, there are no shortage of mathematicians throughout the ages  discussing the [aesthetic qualities of field](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-h-bailey/why-mathematics-matters_b_4794617.html) and moreover there is some [experimental evidence](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26151062) to suggest mathematicians genuinely see beauty in formula's in the same way the rest of us see beauty in music or art. For some, beauty truly is the joy of mathematics.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Building a Chess Program...\n",
    "\n",
    "The above discussion highlighted a few aspirations we should have when trying to come up with a solution to this problem; the more beautiful, generalisable, perfomant we can make our code the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start coding, lets type out a list of things we need to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Represent the board (8x8 grid, alternating black/white squares)\n",
    "1. Define piece movement, capture rules.\n",
    "1. Define all other rules (e.g. promotion, castling, checkmate, 3-fold repetition, etc)\n",
    "1. Peripherals (e.g. clocks, GUI's, multi-player features like match-making, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats a lot of stuff to do right there, today's lecture will mostly deal with points one & two.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the board\n",
    "\n",
    "How should we represent a board in Python? This question mostly just reduces to what data-type we should use. Right now, I have two candidates in mind; strings and lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could of course jump ‘straight-in’, pick one the data types at random and see what happens but, as alluded to in the above discussions such a method is both silly and wasteful. A better use of time would be to carefully consider our options BEFORE we write even a single line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Board as a string\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so let’s consider using a string for the board. What might that look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the letters \"QKPN\" could represent the pieces (lower-case for white), and we could use the new-line escape character (\"\\\\n\") to separate the rows. Something like this:"

I haven't spoken about classes in this lecture series and I'm not going to into detail * (classes are not suitable for a beginner class, in my opinion)* But, I’ll will very briefly introduce you to the concept and how we could use it here. \n",

We looked at a few ways to represent a chess program in Python and although my code today was very ‘loose’ hopefully you guys the followed along and understood the main lesson I was trying to teach; **good, thought-out design matters; it makes coding faster, less frustrating, and also more expressive.**\n",
